  <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>Rustle up a simple omelette for a quick and easy snack any time of day.</p>
    <p>Use mature cheddar for maximum cheesy flavour</p>
  <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>2 eggs</li>
      <li>½ tbsp olive oil</li>
      <li>1 tbsp butter</li>
      <li>15g mature cheddar (finely grated)</li>
    </ul>
  <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
      <li>Crack the eggs into a jug and whisk well with a fork. Season with a pinch of salt.</li>
      <li>Heat the oil and butter in a medium non-stick frying pan over a medium-low heat. Once the butter has started to foam, pour in the eggs and tilt to cover the base of the pan.</li>
      <li>Using a spatula, gently draw in the eggs from four points so there are folds in the centre. Do this once or twice, then leave the eggs to cook gently for 2-3 mins, until there's a little raw egg still in the middle.</li>
      <li>Sprinkle over the cheese and, using your spatula, gently fold the omelette in half.</li>
      <li>Switch off the heat and let the residual heat from the pan melt the cheese for 1 min. Slide onto your plate and sprinkle over some black pepper to serve.</li>
    </ol>
